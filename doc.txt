===========Benifits of creating method=========
1. Code Optimization
2. Reusability 
3. Maintainbility
4. Readibility
5. Debugging is easier
6. Testing becomes easy
7. Documentation can be created easily
8. It allows for more flexibility in the future if needed
9. Allows you to create functions that are used by multiple classes or objects


COnstructor


1 - class and method name is same
2-  can be called using dot operator or as a function call
3-  can take arguments which are passed to the constructor when an object is created
4. constructor has not return type and nor static
4-  can have a return type, if it returns anything then it must be returned in every path of the code 
4-  can have a return type, if it returns anything then it must be returned at the end of the method else there will be compile
4-  can have multiple constructors in java, but they should not have the same signature (data type and number of parameters)
4-  can have a return type, if it returns any value then that value will be assigned to the variable through which we create the object
4-  can have multiple constructors in java, but they should not have the same signature (data type and number of parameters)


difference between method and constructor
-------------------------------------------
Method:
    1. Methods belong to instances of a class while constructors don't. They are invoked on an instance of a class.
    1. Methods are actions performed on objects of a class. They can perform tasks such as adding two numbers, displaying a message etc.
    1. Methods belong to objects while constructors belong to instances of classes.
    2. A method can be called on any instance of a class whereas a constructor can only be called during the creation of a new instance.
    A method is invoked on an instance whereas a constructor is invoked on a class.
    When we create an object from a class, JVM calls the constructor of that class first to initialize the memory allocated for that object. Once the
    2. Methods can perform operations on data members of the class where as constructors initialize the data member values.
    When we invoke a method, we need an instance but when we invoke a constructor, we don't necessarily need an instance.
    2. Methods perform specific tasks related to an object (i.e., they modify the state of an object) whereas constructors initialize
    2. Constructors cannot return any value but methods can.
    3. If we don't provide a constructor in our own class, Java will automatically provide one for us.
       The default constructor doesnâ€™t take any parameters and does nothing.

Constructor Syntax :
   AccessModifier Name (parameter list) { // body }

Example :
class MyClass{
    int x;
    public MyClass(int val){
        x = val;
    }
}

Access Modifiers In Constructors :
1. Public : Can be accessed from anywhere.
2. Private : Only accessible within the class itself.
3. Protected : Accessible within the package and subclasses.
4. No modifier : Accessible only within the package.
5. Default/Package : Accessible within the package and subclasses but not outside the package.
6. Static : Not allowed in constructors because constructors are associated with each object creation
and static members belongs to the class rather than the object.
7. Final : Not allowed in constructors because once a final variable is initialized it cannot be changed.
8. Synchronized : Used for synchronizing threads while initializing the object.
9. Strictfp : Enforces strict accuracy in floating point calculations.


Access Modifiers in short
------------------------------
Private - >within class only
Protected -> within Class / within Package / outside package by sub class
Default -> Class / Package / SubClass
Public -> Everywhere
No access modifier -> Class / Package</s>
